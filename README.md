# 🍽️ Zomato SQL Database Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

This project involves the creation of a relational database for Zomato's restaurant and customer data using SQL Server. The aim is to design a structured schema and write SQL queries to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **SQL Server**: For database management and query execution.


## 🗂 Database Schema

The database schema includes tables such as:

* **Restaurants**: Contains information about restaurants, including name, location, and cuisine type.
* **Customers**: Stores customer details like name, contact information, and preferences.
* **Orders**: Records order details, including order ID, customer ID, restaurant ID, and order date.
* **Reviews**: Captures customer reviews for restaurants, including ratings and comments.

## 🔍 SQL Queries

The project demonstrates the use of various SQL queries to analyze the data:

* **Aggregations**: Calculating average ratings, total orders, and revenue.
* **Joins**: Combining data from multiple tables to gain comprehensive insights.
* **Filtering**: Retrieving data based on specific conditions, such as high-rated restaurants or frequent customers.
* **Grouping**: Organizing data into categories for comparison, like sales by cuisine type.

## 📁 Repository Contents

* `zomato_database.sql`: SQL script to create the database and tables.
* `queries/`: Directory containing SQL query files for various analyses.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📈 Analysis Workflow

1. **Database Creation**: Define the schema and create tables using SQL Server.
2. **Data Insertion**: Populate tables with sample data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Write and execute SQL queries to analyze the data and generate insights.
